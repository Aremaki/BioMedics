## Overall pipelines

BioMedics stands on the shoulders of the library [EDS-NLP](https://github.com/aphp/edsnlp) (a collaborative NLP framework that aims primarily at extracting information from French clinical notes).
BioMedics aims specifically at extracting laboratory test and drug information from clinical note. It consists of two pipelines:

## Setup

- In order to process large-scale data, the study uses [Spark 2.4](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.8/index.html) (an open-source engine for large-scale data processing) which requires to:

  - Install a version of Python $\geq 3.7.1$ and $< 3.8$.
  - Install Java 8 (you can install [OpenJDK 8](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk8/), an open-source reference implementation of Java 8)

- Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Aremaki/BioMedics.git
```

- Create a virtual environment with the suitable Python version (**>= 3.7.1 and < 3.8**):

```shell
cd biomedics
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

- Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python) with the following command line:
    - Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL):

    ```shell
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
    ```

    - Windows (Powershell):

    ```shell
    (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
    ```

    For more details, check the [installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

- Install dependencies:

```shell
poetry install
```
## How to run the code on AP-HP's data platform

### 1. Extract cohort:

- Install EDS-Toolbox (a python library that provides an efficient way of submitting PySpark scripts on AP-HP's data platform. As it is AP-HP specific, it is not available on PyPI):

```shell
pip install edstoolbox
```

- Run the script with EDS-Toolbox:

```shell
cd scripts/create_dataset
bash run.sh
```

### 2. NER + Qualification

<img src="figures/ner_qualif_model.svg" alt="ner_qualif">

Training, evaluation and inference are gathered into one sbatch but you can comment the part you would like to skip in `run.sh`:

```shell
cd scripts/ner
sbtach run.sh
```

### 3. Extract measruement

<img src="figures/extract_measurment.svg" alt="extract_measurement">

```shell
cd scripts/ner
sbtach run.sh
```

### 4. Normalization of laboratory test

The normalization for laboartory test is based on CODER a BERT-based model finetuned on the UMLS:
<img src="figures/extract_measurment.svg" alt="extract_measurement">

```shell
cd scripts/ner
sbtach run.sh
```
### 5. Normalization of drugs

The normalization for drug names is a fuzzy matching on a knowledge dictionnary. This dictionary is an aggregation of two open source dictionaries of drug names with their corresponding ATC codes: the UMLS restricted to the ATC vocabulary and the Unique Drug Interoperability Repository (RUIM) created by the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM):
<img src="figures/extract_measurment.svg" alt="extract_measurement">

```shell
cd scripts/ner
sbtach run.sh
```

### 6. Post processed results for clinical application

```shell
cd scripts/ner
sbtach run.sh
```

### 7. Generate figures

Generate figure one at a time from notebooks:

  - Create a Spark-enabled kernel with your environnement:

    ```shell
    eds-toolbox kernel --spark --hdfs
    ```

   - Convert markdown into jupyter notebook:

      ```shell
      cd notebooks
      jupytext --set-formats md,ipynb 'generate_figures.md'
      ```

   - Open *.ipynb* and start the kernel you've just created.
     - Run the cells to obtain every figure.

#### Note
If you would like to run the scripts on a different database from the AP-HP database, you will have to adapt the python scripts with the configuration of the desired database.
## Project structure

- `conf`: Configuration files.
- `data`: Saved processed data and knowledge dictionnaries.
- `models`: Trained models.
- `figures`: Saved results.
- `notebooks`: Notebooks that generate figures.
- `biomedics`: Source code.
- `scripts`: Scripts to process data.

## Study

This repositoy contains the computer code that has been executed to generate the results of the article:
```
@unpublished{biomedics,
author = {Adam Remaki and Jacques Ung and Pierre Pages and Perceval Wajsburt and Guillaume Faure and Thomas Petit-Jean and Xavier Tannier and Christel GÃ©rardin},
title = {Improving phenotyping of patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases through automated processing of discharge summaries: a multicenter cohort study},
note = {Manuscript submitted for publication},
year = {2024}
}
```
The code has been executed on the OMOP database of the clinical data warehouse of the  <a href="https://eds.aphp.fr/" target="_blank">Greater Paris University Hospitals</a>
